An app that promts a user in the command line to input various employee information that will generate in an html file. The file can be viewed in the browser as well.

    When the user runs node and the index.js file in the command line, inquirer will prompt the user for information pertenant to a specific employee: Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Once the user has indicated that they have finished inputing the team memebers information in the terminal by typing n when prompted, an html file following a template will be generated and unlike the template it will have the dynamically created employee cards displayed inside.
